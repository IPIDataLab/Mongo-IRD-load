Mongo-IRD-load
==============

This is a package of utility functions that parse incoming KAICIID Excel data into JSON and load directly into a Mongo instance. This will be a one shot use when the IRD is migrated from shared Excel editing to a server-based Mongo instance with backend API access for new and updated records.
