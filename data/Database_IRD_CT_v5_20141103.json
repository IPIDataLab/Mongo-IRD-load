Bishop Swing hired a small staff in San Francisco and launched a four-year organizational design process that included meetings among hundreds of stakeholders of diverse religions, cultures and disciplines all over the world. What emerged was a group of committed founders who formed the heart of URI\u2019s global community, and a highly regarded, inclusive Charter that provides a unique, grassroots-based structure and a set of principles for action on behalf of the common good. With the signing of this Charter, the global URI organization was born on June 26, 2000."

In inter-religious, inter-ideological dialogue we must not compare our ideals with our partner's practice, but rather our ideals with our partner's ideals, our practice with our partner's practice. Each participant must define himself... Conversely, the interpreted must be able to recognize herself in the interpretation. Each participant must come to the dialogue with no hard-and-fast assumptions as to where the points of disagreement are. Dialogue can take place only between equals... Both must come to learn from each other. Dialogue can take place only on the basis of mutual trust. Persons entering into inter-religious, inter-ideological dialogue must be at least minimally self-critical of both themselves and their own religious or ideological traditions.

Each production of The Team follows the characters on a football team who must overcome their differences \u2013 be they cultural, ethnic, religious, tribal, racial or socio-economic \u2013 in order to work together to win the game.

We apply dialogic approaches to these meetings. In addition, we also encourage all participants to connect with their inner world and thereby experience the inter-relatedness and interdependence of all human beings and of all life in the world.

In 1960 an Alliance for International Monasticism was established to support this expansion. Superiors of the new monasteries met in Africa in 1964 and again in 1968 in Thailand. Then, in October 1973 a historic interfaith gathering of monastics took place in Bangalore, India. The topic was The Experience of God. As a result of that meeting, Rome asked the Benedictine Order to become actively involved in interreligious dialogue, since \"monasticism is the bridge between religions\"."

Before the conference ended, however, World War I had started and those present had to return to their respective countries. At a railroad station in Germany, two of the participants, Henry Hodgkin, an English Quaker, and Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze, a German Lutheran, pledged to find a way of working for peace even though their countries were at war. Out of this pledge Christians gathered in Cambridge, England in December 1914 to found the Fellowship of Reconciliation. The US FOR was founded one year later, in November 1915, at a conference in Garden City, Long Island, New York."

People need to resist the urge to engage in dispute or debate. Listening is arguably the most important skill in dialogue, closely followed by questioning for understanding. Dialogue is an art that is both tentative and tolerant. Ideally, there is no \u201cother\u201d in the room, only brothers and sisters, who share an ancestral heritage and a rich history in which there have been periods of symbiosis and cultural efflorescence, as well as economic strife, political and military conflict and religious oppression. Dialogue cannot rewrite history, but it can make history. It is desirable to clarify the goals of dialogue for all who are participating: to listen, to question, to learn, to explore, and ultimately to search together for a common language and perhaps a shared vision. Dialogue requires openness, a willingness to have one\u2019s opinion changed, to become, in part, a different person as a result of a conversation. Dialogue is not a magical cure to enmity, but dialogue can build bridges between people and communities, and have a humanizing effect that can yield healthy relationships, including friendships.",
