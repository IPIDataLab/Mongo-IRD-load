        "history":"CIIS was established by the Carmelites of Mary Immaculate religious Congregation, when Very Rev. Dr. Theobald Pothankckad was its Prior General, in 1977 as a response to the call of Second Vatican Council to undertake study and research of other religions with a view to enter into dialogue with them. Recognizing its unprecedented growth the Centre has been elevated to the status of an Institute changing its name from Centre for Indian and Interreligious Studies (CIIS) into Chavara Institute of Indian and Interreligious Studies (CIIS), Rome. Considering its continued contributions in the field of interreligious studies and further enhancing the academic excellence, in 2010 at the request of Rev. Dr. Isaac Arickappalil CMI the Institute has been declared as an extension centre of Dharmaram Vidya Kshetram (DVK), Pontifical Athenaeum of Philosophy, Theology and Canon Law, Bangalore, India"
