People need to resist the urge to engage in dispute or debate. Listening is arguably the most important skill in dialogue, closely followed by questioning for understanding. Dialogue is an art that is both tentative and tolerant. Ideally, there is no \u201cother\u201d in the room, only brothers and sisters, who share an ancestral heritage and a rich history in which there have been periods of symbiosis and cultural efflorescence, as well as economic strife, political and military conflict and religious oppression. Dialogue cannot rewrite history, but it can make history. It is desirable to clarify the goals of dialogue for all who are participating: to listen, to question, to learn, to explore, and ultimately to search together for a common language and perhaps a shared vision. Dialogue requires openness, a willingness to have one\u2019s opinion changed, to become, in part, a different person as a result of a conversation. Dialogue is not a magical cure to enmity, but dialogue can build bridges between people and communities, and have a humanizing effect that can yield healthy relationships, including friendships.",

In the present age, characterized by the challenges of globalization, militarization, poverty, social injustice, oppression, and environmental degradation, peace education is crucial to reverse the trend towards mutual destruction. Interfaith and peace education needs to be put into the curriculum of every school at every level, and into the religious education program of every temple, church and mosque world-wide. With this ultimate goal in mind, Global Family for Love and Peace has initiated and sponsored a series of dialogues in different parts of the world. The Dialogues' goals are to create a partnership between religious communities in order to face the numerous challenges of the 21st century on a peaceful basis of cooperation and friendship.",
